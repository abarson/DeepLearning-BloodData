Some notes about data augmentation implementation choices:

Augmentation done so far:
    === double speed of video
    === halve speed of video

notes:
    === found that ratio of respiratory to heart rate is approximately
        1:4, so when doubling and halving video speed we double/halve 
        the heart rate and take the resulting number and divide by 4
